These are all the assignments my class had to do during the Fall Term of CECS451 under Kate Nguyen at CSULB. 

Inside each assignment folder, there is a README.md document, marking out what score I recieved on the assignment, and the correct solutions to problems I got incorrect.

I hope that this will be of some use to the students in the future who have to take this class.
